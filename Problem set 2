Prob 1:

Write a program which takes two values x and y. Prints x for y number of times.

Input:

2 

3

Expected Output

2

2

2

Explanation - 2 is x and 3 is y in the input. So 2 is printed 3 times on the output.

ANSWER

# Read two values from the user
x = input()  # Value to print
y = int(input())  # Number of times to print

# Print x, y number of times
for _ in range(y):
    print(x)

Prob 2:

Write a program to take x and print multiples of x till 1000.

Input:

100

Expected Output:

100

200

300

400

500

600

700

800

900

1000

Explanation - Input is 100, multiples of 100 is 100*1, 100*2, 100*3 and so on till 1000.

ANSWER

# Read the input value
x = int(input())

# Print multiples of x up to 1000
for i in range(1, (1000 // x) + 1):
    print(x * i)


Prob 3:

Write a program to get firstName and lastName and n as input and print fullName that is firstName+lastName for n times.

Input

Nandy

Raja

5

Expected output:

NandyRaja

NandyRaja

NandyRaja

NandyRaja

NandyRaja

Explanation - Nandy is the firstName, Raja is the lastName and n is 5, so the expected output has NandyRaja printed 5 times.

ANSWER

# Read inputs from the user
firstName = input()
lastName = input()
n = int(input())

# Combine firstName and lastName
fullName = firstName + lastName

# Print fullName n times
for _ in range(n):
    print(fullName)
